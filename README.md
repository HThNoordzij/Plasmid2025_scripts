# Plasmid2025_scripts
Scripts used for the analysis of the article "Assembly-based analysis of the infant gut microbiome reveals novel ubiquitous plasmids" submitted to the journal Plasmid.

The installation scripts are not meant as a tutorial how to install the different software tools but are specific for our university's supercomputer.
The remainder of the scripts make our analysis transparent  to facilitate Open Science.
